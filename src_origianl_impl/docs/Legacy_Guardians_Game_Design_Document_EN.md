## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Parent-Child Interaction Gameplay (Family Loop)**

### **Roles and Objectives**

* **Child Side**: Use "Adventure Coins" to operate artifacts/asset cards, pursue steady Skyland restoration and collect badges
* **Parent Side**: Set boundaries and themes, approve adventure quotas, view journey reviews and guide next steps

### **Loop Process (Application → Approval → Adventure → Settlement → Feedback)**

#### 1. **Adventure Application (Child)**
* Click "Start Adventure" in "Guardian Camp", fill in required adventure coins (e.g., 50 coins)
* System generates "Adventure Scroll", sent to parent side for processing

#### 2. **Approval Management (Parent)**
* Parents approve/reject/adjust quotas in "Council Hall"
* Configurable automatic rules: Single/weekly/monthly limits, allowed asset pools (e.g., ETFs only: Tech/Bonds/ESG/Stablecoins)
* Light prompts: Show current theme (e.g., "Diversification")

#### 3. **Simulation Experience (Child)**
* Use approved adventure coins to adjust weights or unlock new themes, respecting boundaries
* Daily/weekly settlement, forming virtual profit/loss and treasure changes (pure simulation)

#### 4. **Adventure Settlement (Pure Simulation)**
* **Simulated Gains**: Adventure coins fluctuate with portfolio performance, award stars/badges/props
* **Simulated Losses**: Only reflected in virtual adventure coins, AI companion provides comfort and strategy tips

#### 5. **Feedback (AI Companion + Parent Report)**
* **AI Companion Examples**:
  * "Hey, the crystal looks a bit dim today, let's see how to make the treasure more stable?"
  * "Great! The forest is thriving, but smart guardians also prepare for tomorrow~"
* **Parent Report**: Diversification, volatility sensitivity, challenge completion, next step suggestions; supports certificate generation (PDF/image)

### **Family Challenges (Optional)**

* **Green Mission**: Allocate 20% weight to ESG, observe for one cycle
* **Hedging Challenge**: Experience gold/stablecoin's anti-decline properties during storm week
* **Yield Exploration**: Put some assets in "Yield Temple", experience passive gold generation
* **Stability Experience**: Feel "Stable Spring's" smoothing effect during high volatility periods

### **Boundaries and Safety (Design Constraints)**

* **Complete Simulation**: Adventure coins and processes are virtual, zero financial risk
* **Parent Controlled**: Adjust quotas, whitelist, and difficulty anytime
* **Clear Labeling**: UI emphasizes "Simulation/Educational Use", avoid trading associations

## 🌍 **World and Narrative Packaging**

### **Long-term Goals and Milestones (No Endgame)**

Progress through ranks by restoring "Legendary Skyland (The Legacy Skyland)", staged recovery performances, no endgame completion, encouraging long-term progression.

### **Background Story**

Ancient Skyland symbolizes wealth and wisdom, shattered by "Economic Storms", artifacts scattered. New guardians collect fragments through wise choices, inject energy into Skyland; treasure grows steadily, unlocking areas and events.

* **Visual Semantics**: Forest (Tech), Snow Mountain (Bonds), Golden Temple (Gold), Oasis (ESG), Lake (Stable), Temple (Yield), Star Sea (Crypto)
* **Event Imagery**: Mist (Uncertainty), Storm (Crash), Sunlight (Bull Market), Aftershock (Volatility Continuation)
* **Narrative Style**: AI partner reminds in companion tone, minimal jargon, emphasis on metaphors and questions
